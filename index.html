                        <p>I've worked for the GRID Lab at Ohio University for almost 3 years now, but mostly doing graphics and user experience design for various types of educational projects we've been hired for. When a coworker, who was directing the project, was looking for an AD, they asked me because of my track record of organization and punctuality. I was nervous, but I said yes!</p>
                        <p>This project is meant to help professors become more comfortable with the process of approaching a student they feel might need mental health assistance. It follows a student named Jade who starts as a bright and promising pupil and over the course of time, begins to deteriorate because of relationship violence. The video, consisting of both traditional and 360° video content, starts in the classroom and chronicles how the professor assists Jade in seeking help.</p>

                        <p>In addition to assisstant directing, I also was resposible for the prop and wardrobe design. Most of this process was focused on time-lapse that shows Jade slowly deteriorating over time and her preparedness for class and energy decreases.</p>
                        <p>My responsibilies included acquiring and planning the setup of the props surrounding Jade in each stage of the classroom scenes.</p>

                    <p>One of the bigggest responsibilites of the Assitant Director is to create call sheets for the cast and crew. These are very detailed documents that state what time each person needs to be present on set, where the sets are located, what they need to bring, the eqipment needed, and the shot schedule!</p>

                        <h4>Assistant Directing</h4>
                        <p>My main duty on set was to keep everything on schedule and make sure the director and main camera knew how much time we had for each shot. This can sometimes be tricky if we have to do a lot of takes of a particular scene, it's easy to get behind. Thankfully, we only ran about an hour late on the first day of shooting and finished an hour early on the second day!</p>
                        <p>As the assistent director I was also the liason between the actors and the director. The topic we are filming on required the actors to channel strong emotions, which means they might need to step away to recollect. If this is necessary, or if they have any other needs, they are encouraged to come to me.</p>

                        <p>This was a suprise job on the first day of shooting!I was super excited because this is something you see a lot and to get to do it on my first day of set was exciting! I demarked every scene and take on the white board surface, held the slate in front of the camera (along with the color palette), and read the information out loud. This job definitely required a lot of multitasking, but I enjoyed it!</p>
                        <p>Each scene has its own technique for how hard or soft to slam the sticks down. Additionally, there is specific codenames for every movement. I definitely was not perfect but it's suprising how compicated something I thought was simple could be!</p>

                    <p>For sections of the training video shot in 360° video, we used a special technique to make it look like you become one of the actors. The VR camera was mounted on top of of a lightstand with a mannequin hanging on it. We then dressed the mannquein in matching clothes with the actor. To film the scene, the actor would sit behind the camera and wrap his/her legs and arms around the mannequin. The screen grabs above show the final result!</p>

                        <p>As you can see from the picture, this technique requires the actor to be face to face with the backside of the 360° camera in order to get the desired effect. </p>
                        <p>After shooting the scenes with the actors, we would then carefully move the actor out of the scene, sure to not shift the camera at all. Then, we move all the lights to the other side of the room and shoot seperate footage of the back of the chair and the room behind the head. </p>
                        <p>Lastly, in post-production, we will edit the front 180° of the first footage and the back 180° of the second footage together to create the sense that you are the actor.</p>

                        <h4>Learning How to AD</h4>
                        <p>Overall, I learned a lot during this process, about being on set and about myself! I was super nervous leading up to the project but in the end, the clients were ecastatic. Now, the videos we shot will go into post-production. </p>
                        <p>I learned that I can perform under pressure and handle long work days working with a variety of different creatives! Everyone on my team is super professional and an honor to work with. With a small team and an even smaller budget, I think we created something with really high production value!</p>
                        <p>The production is set to be finished by the end of the semester, when we will pass it to our clients, Patti McSteen <i>(Dean of Students)</i> and Det. Rick Sargert <i>(OU Police Department).</i> If they approve of everything, we will proceed with a second scenario of the program in the summer.</p>
